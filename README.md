# OptimxAI

ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ Big News: We were selected for a Y Combinator interview (Winter 2023 Batch)!

## Overview

Welcome to the GitHub repository for **OptimxAI**. This repository serves as the central hub for our company, which has evolved significantly over time. Initially focused on fine-tuning and deploying AI models, we have since pivoted to automating the creation of Jira tickets for product managers, making their workflows more efficient.

### About OptimxAI

OptimxAI started as a company dedicated to refining and deploying AI models. Over time, we recognized a bigger challenge in product management: streamlining task management. Today, we leverage AI to automate Jira ticket creation, helping product managers save time and focus on strategy.

### Key Features (Post-Pivot)

- **Automated Jira Ticket Creation**: AI-powered automation that generates Jira tickets based on product specs and discussions.
- **Context-Aware AI**: Our system intelligently extracts key details from conversations, documents, and reports to create well-structured Jira issues.
- **Seamless Integration**: Easily integrates with existing workflows, improving productivity without disruption.
